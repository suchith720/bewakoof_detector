# Bewakoof Detector

* I trained this cool image classifier using the fastai library to mess with my friend who we both agree is bewakoof with directions.

* Checkout my [blog](https://suchith720.github.io/posts/research/bewakoof-detector/) for more information.

* I have created a [web app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/suchith720/bewakoof_detector) where you can upload your image to check if you bewakoof like her.


> The information is related to deployment the App to huggingface spaces.
